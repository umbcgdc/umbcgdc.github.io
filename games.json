Each implementation posed new concrete challenges with rendering, collision handling, media loading and management. We discovered FlashPunk as a sufficient code base that met our needs.

They construct characters and objects using primitive polygons, like spheres and cubes. Once modeled, objects are UV mapped, a process that converts the 3D faces of a model to a 2D plane. Using this map, artists can paint over it and map it back on to the model, completing a process known as texturing. Finally, for characters, models are given bones and joints known as a rig so that an animator may give the character life.</p>",

DirectX provides the application with an interface to the graphics hardware (Direct3D) as well as interfaces to input devices (Direct Input). DirectX is provided by Microsoft for free and is the most commonly used toolset for graphics in Windows.</p><p>The next layer is Gamebryo which is a Game Engine. Gamebryo provides an interface for creating basic game objects. It hides the DirectX layer and therefore simplifies the above layers of code. Gamebryo is not specific to Project Tetra but rather generalized game code written by a company known as Emergent.</p><p>On top of Gamebryo sits the game layer. This layer consists of code specific to the game. It is written in C++ and is compiled into the application. It manages the core game play functionality that is not likely to change during the development process.</p><p>Next there is the script interface layer. This layer consists of managed C++ that can be used by the script system. This layer acts as a middle man between the core game code and the script system.</p><p>The top layer is our C# script system. The script system is used to easily modify the game. Scripts define things such as character classes and character skills. They are also used to make basic decisions such as what music to play or when to open a door.</p>"

                "description": "Mercury is a C++, Open Source, Multi-platform, Multi-threaded Game Engine that runs fully featured on Linux and Windows®. It is worked on by a few GDC members. Mercury compiles in GCC3.2 - 4.1 in Linux, and many different compilers in Windows®.",
                "customhtml": "<p>Mercury isn't just a graphics library, but a full programming environment. In general, code designed to be run in Mercury needs not to make calls to the system or any functions that would be platform dependent. Despite this, Mercury should remain small and applications that utilize it should not have to suffer exaggerated load times for features they do not use. Mercury's registration system allows different features to be compiled in without modification of other code. For example, if there is no need for physics in your project, the ODE library and code (what we use for physics) can simply not be linked and ODE will not be used.</p><p>Mercury is designed around open source fundamentals. Most of what you will see supported in Mercury and used with Mercury is Open. We feel that you should be able to develop a great game without having to purchase proprietary tools and systems.</p><p>Mercury's primary goal is speed. Mercury sacrifices some of the benefits that are gained by clean coding when a noticeable performance increase can be found for the end user. Assembly code for common math functions being compiled in Windows for extra performance is an example of the paramount of speed in Mercury. We've re-written some of the STL data types for added functionality as well as improved performance.</p>",
