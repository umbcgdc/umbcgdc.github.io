If charged stablely the emitted gravity field effects can be used to curve projectiles, make force barriers, or even flush out opponents.</li><li>Graphics are rich and can be taxing for a computer. We set a small restriction which was rarely violated, to keep models under 10,000 polygons for a single model.</li><li>Level design mainly consists of futuristic developing colonies.

Making his way deep underground in search of the source of this darkness, the main character is aided by only trace amounts of light that remain. The player must take advantage of his prism-like body to split light into a variety of colors, each of which gives him a special ability. These abilities are useful in solving puzzles and defeating enemies, bringing him closer to reaching the source of darkness and restoring light to the world.",

Many technical problems were avoided or easily worked around, allowing the team to focus on gameplay mechanics. Most of the time the player has very limited abilities, except when in the presence of light, which the player can use to harness special abilities - one for each color on the Xbox 360 controller. The main puzzle mechanic focuses on shooting light off a series of reflective surfaces, bouncing it at the correct angles so that the beam of light eventually hits a target that will change some part of the level and allow progression to the next room.</p><p>The team first worked on getting the mechanics working, and then shifted focus to building a world and puzzles. The goal was to have three levels, starting in a dark forest and progressing underground into a cave and finally to an underground temple where the story concludes.</p>"

Each of the four starting classes; Warrior, Alchemist, Rogue and Ranger, have their own unique abilities and skills. Mechanics originate from Multi User Dungeons (MUDs), room-based combat, quests, and node-connected world maps. Mechanics are also drawn from modern RPGs and modernized graphics. Developement involved Flash and Actionscript 3, through the gaming library FlashPunk, developed by Chevy Ray Johnston (flashpunk.net).",

This required efficient handling of object creation, level loading, and player state management. We developed several prototype engines and systems for handling these aspects of the code. Each implementation posed new concrete challenges with rendering, collision handling, media loading and management. We discovered FlashPunk as a sufficient code base that met our needs. Then, we ported our existing code into the current prototype. The prototype demonstrates an initial level and single player class in this environment. We also utilize an excellent 2D Map editor called <a href='http://www.ogmoeditor.com/'>OGMO</a>, which simplifies the process of adding and customizing levels for the game. Utilizing xml projects and level files, OGMO produces levels that can be directly integrated into the game engine.</p><p>Future goals include more levels, character models and development of mechanics. We plan to incorporate a real-time turn-based combat system that will add more dynamic and strategic gameplay thus improving combat. Also, we will continue to develop simple conventions so that this code can be reused to produce other tileset/top-down games.</p>"
