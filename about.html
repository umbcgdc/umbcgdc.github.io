  <p>The lab room we meet in has computers any UMBC student can use.

<gamedev-dropdown label="Annual Game Jam">
  <p>A Game Jam is a period of time (usually 48 hours) where everyone comes together to pitch new game ideas around a theme, form teams based on what you’re interested in, and make a small prototype of your idea! (Sleep is optional!)</p>

  <p>Every year during the first few weeks of the Fall semester, we have our Annual Game Jam. The games that come from this Jam are voted on, with the primary factors of whom had good team cohesion, has the skills to create the idea proposed, and an idea that could be made in an academic year.</p>

  <p>The games voted in will then be made for the rest of the academic year! These project games will work with the goal of making a small polished product to show employers and the UMBC community at a number of events such as URCAD, Gamescape, Reverse Career Fair, MAGFEST, and more!</p>

<gamedev-dropdown label="Career Opportunities">
<p>The club strives to help students get jobs and internships in a variety of different fields and upgrade their resumes and portfolios by putting the students into a productive, team-based environment, where they set milestones and deadlines by themselves to push a presentable product.</p>

<p>The club works with several groups such as the IGDA and Baltimore Unreal Engine Group to help students get used to networking and interacting with professionals in the game industry.</p>

<p>Through our networking, we bring in several industry veterans to present and give lectures to the club on topics ranging from the reality of the industry, to music, art, and programming.</p>
